Welcome to **Alerta**, my solo project in a long while — and yes, it's time to green up my GitHub graph!  
This project aims to build a basic **fraud detection** checker using real-world data handling and preprocessing techniques.

## ✨ Where Have I Been?

I’ve been **leveling up** behind the scenes:
- Earned a **SAP Technology Consultant** certification  
- Currently training to become a **SAP General Consultant** with Umuzi  

The journey's been tough, but I’m all about growth.

## ⚡ What Sparked This Project?

A fellow dev [let's call him Krazy](github.com/krazygenus) gave me a much-needed wake-up call about my GitHub activity — and honestly, he wasn’t wrong.

After looking through my repos, I saw the silence. So I decided to kickstart **Alerta**, a project aligned with what we’re currently working on.  
This isn’t the final build, but it's a step forward.
